## About

This is a version of LESS, a file viewer, that has been modified heavily.
It is based on Mark Nudelman's original program, Less v458.  The original
less is located at
[http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/](http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/)

This version is modified to work better on POSIX systems, and uses APIs that
older systems and non-POSIX platforms might lack.  In many cases these newer
APIs have improved safety or performance.

It is also modified to substantially improve its compliance with the POSIX
specifications when running as `more`.  We believe that when called as `more`,
less fully implements both Issue 6 and Issue 7 specified behaviors of the more
utility.

Finally, substantial effort has been invested to improve the readability and
maintainability of the code, and to avoid reimplementing library functions
found on standard systems.

An incomplete list of changes is located in the file [CHANGES](CHANGES).

## Acknowledgements

Mark Nudelman created the original Less program, which we have used for
many years on many platforms.

The OpenBSD team has contributed a number of improvements, mostly
oriented around safety and hardening of the code.

## Building

If you have [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) 3.1 or newer, then that is
probably the best option:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

Alternatively, you can use the Makefile where we have some default
targets based on build type.  Use `make STD=<x>` where `x` is one of:

* `ILLUMOS`
* `MACOS`
* `SUSv4`
* `SUSv3`
* `SUSv2`

See the Makefile for more details.  There is a `STD=default` option you can
try if your platform isn't listed.  (CMake is more likely to yield a positive
result in this case, however.)

Enjoy!
